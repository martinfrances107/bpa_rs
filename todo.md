# TODO

## Build for wasm

## Publish on crates.io

## Publish ply2stl

get dragon running.
prepare images.
Document number of triangles per sec, for bunny and dragon.
flamegraphs -- look for unexpected time hogs.

## Refinement

Run DHAT
**Benchmarks**
Clippy

## Strategies for handling lifetimes?

keep points in the same lifetime as Grid
keep all Vec < Vertices >
